				Whenever I start a new project that I think will turn into something more than just a little experiment on the side,
				I like to do a little bit of research on any packages that I might install from npm
				(or whatever package manager I might be using at the time) to see if packages are still actively being maintained and how the community feels about them.
				<br/><br/>
				I usually go about this by doing a quick glance at how often an npm package is being installed,
				looking at commit frequency, how quickly / often do maintainers respond to comments, etc.
				I also sometimes end up doing this for multiple packages that do similar things to compare my options.
				<br/><br/>
				I'm first wondering if I'm silly, there is already something out there,
				and I can't google to save my life? But if not, do you think folks would find something like that useful?

			<p>
				I posed this <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/any-tool-out-there-to-determine-a-github-repos-reputation-stale-ness-30ac39a0b7">question</a> some time ago.
				At the time, I was working on a side project and trying to determine whether the Github repository for a certain NPM package was 'active' or not. 
				Now that I have some extra time, I'm currently building out a proof of concept.
